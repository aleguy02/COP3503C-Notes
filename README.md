# COP3503C - Lab Demos

This repository contains notes and demos that I've prepared for my weekly lab sessions in **Programming Fundamentals II (COP3503C)**. Each folder corresponds to a specific week where I created and presented a demo. 

## Structure

- **Weekly Folders**: Only weeks for which I created a demo will have a corresponding folder. If a week is missing, it means no demo was prepared for that session.
